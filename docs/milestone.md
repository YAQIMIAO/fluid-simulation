# Milestone Status Report: Position Based Fluid Simulation

## Summary
We decided to do the position based simulation of the fluid motion first. We implemented a basic UI that can be controlled with:

Key | Description
ESC, Q | Close window
up, down, left, right | Rotate view
Space | Run simulation for 1 step

Now we can run a simple simulation of fluid with the effect of gravity.
